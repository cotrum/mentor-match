## Instructions
1. Download and unzip the repository into a folder on your computer. Navigate until you see 3 folders and 2 
files: pagesFolder, projectDocuments, and resources, along with the 2 files index.html and README.md.
2. Using Github Desktop, open your iit repository in VSCode (or prefered IDE). Inside your iit folder, create a new folder and drag and drop the 3 folders and 2 files into it. 
3. Navigate to pagesFolder, then resources, databases, and finally into sqlLoginInfo.php. Here, enter your phpadmin account username and password.
4. Start your Azure instance and navigate to "<YOUR FQDN>/iit/phpmyadmin".
5. Create a new database called team7.
6. Inside the team7 database, click import. Import the users.sql file within resources/databases.
7. Finally, in your iit website, make sure you have a link somewhere that allows users to navigate to the index.html (home page) of this website.

Quick Note: If you are using a touch screen computer, when swiping on tutors, make sure to swipe up and right using the touchscreen. If your computer is not touch screen, then use your mouse/trackpad to swipe the cards.
