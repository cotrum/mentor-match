## How to View
1.) Download repository as a zip file. Unzip file into a folder on your computer. Go into the folder/each sub folder until you see the following 3 folders and 2 
files. These being the pagesFolder, projectDocuments, and resources folders. The 2 files are index.html and a READEME.
2.) Navigate to github desktop, and open your iit repository in VSCode (or prefered IDE). Inside of your iit folder here, create a new
    folder called teamPage. Then, drag and drop the 3 folders and 2 files from the previous step, into this tempPage folder. 
3.) Go inside pagesFolder, then resources, databases, and finally into sqlLoginInfo.php. Here, enter your username and password that is associated to your 
    phpmyadmin account.
4.) Start Azure instance, and navigate to "<YOUR FQDN>/iit/phpmyadmin".
5.) Create a new database called team7.
6.) Inside the team7 database, click import from the top bar. Select choose a file and get into your iit folder. Once inside, open the resources folder, then databases, and then click users.sql.
7.) Finally, in your iit website, make sure somewhere you have a link that allows users to navigate to the index.html (home page) of this website.
